    Ant Smash
    A game hastily thrown together by Jonathan Gover
    Copyright (c) jonathan gover january 2004

    Created for the 72 hour compo.

    The ants try and steal your picnic.  Stop them with your mallet.  If the ants are carrying away your food, smash it.  The longer you wait to smash the food the higher the score, but if you leave it too long the ants will steal it and you'll lose points.
